<p>Cryptography is the study of mathematical techniques related to various aspects of information security.
Refer to slides for definitions of ‚Äúadversary‚Äù (passive and active) and ‚Äúchannel‚Äù (secure and unsecure).</p>

<p>Encryption using the key $e$ and decryption using the key $d$ are represented as $E_{e}(\cdot)$ and $D_{d}(\cdot)$ respectively. The plaintext message is represented as $M$ and the ciphertext as $C$.</p>

<p>The aim in cryptography is for an encryption scheme to be unbreakable, i.e., for the problem of plaintext recovery (without prior knowledge of the key pair) to be computationally infeasible.</p>

<h2 id="symmetric-and-asymmetric-encryption">Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
<p>In symmetric-key encryption, the same key can be used for encryption as well as decryption. The key needs to be conveyed to the receiver via a secure channel for this form of communication.</p>

<p>In asymmetric-key encryption, however, there are two keys - a private and a public key. Each person has his or her own private key, known to no one else, and a public key, which is available to everyone. The private key can be used to decrypt a message encrypted using the public key, and vice versa. RSA is a common algorithm for asymmetric encryption.</p>

<h2 id="the-rsa-public-key-cryptosystem">The RSA Public-Key Cryptosystem</h2>
<p>This cryptosystem relies on modular arithmetic (specifically, Euler‚Äôs Theorem) and the computational infeasibility of factoring large numbers.
We will consider that Alice would like to send a message $M$ to her friend Bob.</p>

<p>The key includes a number $n$, which is the product of two large, distinct primes $p$ and $q$.
We know that $\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)$.</p>

<p>Both Alice and Bob have a private and a public key each. Their public keys are known to each other, while their private keys are not. Alice uses Bob‚Äôs public key $(e,n)$ to encrypt the message, and Bob decrypts it using his private key $(d,n)$.</p>

<p>$e$ and $d$ are numbers such that $d \equiv e^{-1}$ (mod $\phi(n)$), i.e., $ed \equiv 1$ (mod $\phi(n)$).</p>

<p>According to Euler‚Äôs Theorem,
if $gcd(a,n) = 1$, then $a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1$ (mod n).</p>

<p>As $p$ and $q$ are both large primes, we take them both to be coprime to $M$, the plaintext message. Consequently, $gcd(M,n) = 1$.</p>

<h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
<p>Alice raises the message $M$ to the power of Bob‚Äôs public key $e$ and takes the remainder modulo $n$ to obtain the ciphertext $C$, i.e.,</p>

<p>$C \equiv M^{e}$ (mod n).</p>

<h3 id="decryption">Decryption</h3>
<p>Bob receives the ciphertext $C$. To decrypt it, he raises it to the power of his private key $d$ and takes the remainder modulo $n$.</p>

<p>$C^{d} \equiv M^{ed}$ (mod n).</p>

<p>However, since $ed \equiv 1$ (mod $\phi(n)$), we know that $ed = k \phi(n) + 1$ for some $k$. Substituting this,</p>

<p>$M^{ed} = M^{k \phi(n) + 1}$</p>

<p>$= M^{k \phi(n)} \cdot M^{1}$</p>

<p>$= {(M^{\phi(n)})}^{k} \cdot M$</p>

<p>$\equiv 1^{k} \cdot M$ (mod n), by Euler‚Äôs Theorem and since $gcd(M,n) = 1$</p>

<p>$\equiv M$ (mod n).</p>

<p>Since $M &lt; n$, the above yields $M$ itself, and Bob has decrypted the message.</p>

<h3 id="an-example">An Example</h3>

<p>Let the message be encoded as a number, say $M = 6$.</p>

<p>Let $p = 13, q = 17$. Therefore $n = 221$ and $\phi(n) = 192$.</p>

<p>Suppose $e = 77$. Since $d = e^{-1}$ (mod $\phi(n)$), $d = 5$.</p>

<p><strong>Encryption.</strong> $C \equiv M^{e}$ (mod n) $\equiv 6^{77}$ (mod 221) $= 197$.</p>

<p>Hence $C = 197$ is the ciphertext.</p>

<p><strong>Decryption.</strong> $M \equiv C^{d}$ (mod n) $\equiv 197^{5}$ (mod 221) $\equiv 6$ (mod 221).</p>

<p>Hence the plaintext message $M = 6$ is retrieved and can be decoded to obtain the original message.</p>
