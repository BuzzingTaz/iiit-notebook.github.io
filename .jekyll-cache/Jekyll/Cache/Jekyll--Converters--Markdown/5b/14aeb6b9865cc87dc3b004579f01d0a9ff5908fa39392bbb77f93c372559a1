<p>Its function is to convert alternate current to direct current.
What we need is a “current steering block” to take this output with its constantly switching polarity, and put it back out in only one single direction.
One implementation is to use switches in a diamond configuration, turning them on and off according to our requirement, but implementing this with mechanical switches would be very difficult.
We can instead use <em>diodes</em>. A diode is a 2-terminal electronic device, which allows current to pass through it when <em>forward-biased</em> and will block the current when <em>reverse-biased</em>. Thus we can construct what is known as a <strong>bridge rectifier</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="filter">Filter</h2>

<p>After rectifying the wave and limiting it to one polarity, we get quite a bumpy waveform ($\lvert\sin{x}\rvert$), so this wave form has to be filtered to allow us to get something which better approximates a pure DC. This is done by filtering, and to do this we attach a capacitor in parallel. The charge-discharge cycle of the capacitor causes the current to not vary as much.
There is a bit of a “ripple” still left over, and we select the rating of our capacitor accordingly.  Since the ripple is formed by the charge/discharge of the capacitor, we can reduce the ripple by selecting C such that discharge time constant is much greater than the period of our rectified wave.
\(R_L C &gt;&gt; T; T= \frac{1}{f};\)
where $f$ is the frequency of the rectified wave.
\(\frac{V_L}{I_Lmax} &gt;&gt; \frac{1}{f}\)
\(C &gt;&gt; \frac{I_Lmax}{fV_l}\)</p>

<p>While designing this we use 
\(R_LC = \alpha\frac{1}{f}\)
where $\alpha$ is our <em>design parameter</em></p>

<p>Suppose $V_Lmax = 5V; I_Lmax = 1A$.
Then if $f = 100Hz$, 
\(C = \alpha \frac{1}{(100)(5)}\)
Instead, if $f = 50kHz$, 
\(C = \alpha \frac{1}{(5\times10^4)(5)}\)</p>

<p>So by increasing the frequency, we greatly decrease the capacitance needed to filter our output, something of great significance in appliances like mobile chargers.</p>

<h2 id="regulator">Regulator</h2>

<p>For the purpose of regulating our output to be a constant voltage, we take the assistance of a <strong>zener diode</strong>, a special kind of diode with the amazing property that under reverse bias, it can lock the voltage to a fixed value under ‘zener breakdown’.</p>

<p><img src="004fig2.png" alt="Zener diode in place" /></p>

<p>We place our zener diode in reverse bias in parallel across our load. We also need a minimum <em>‘knee current’</em> across the zener in order to ensure it behaves as a voltage regulator.
We used the fact that because of this the voltage across the load is constant and equal to zener voltage, and a simple application of Ohm’s law, to get the useful equations
\(I_L = I_S - I_Z = V_Z(\frac{1}{R_L})\)
\(I_S = (V - V_Z)(\frac{1}{R_S})\)</p>
