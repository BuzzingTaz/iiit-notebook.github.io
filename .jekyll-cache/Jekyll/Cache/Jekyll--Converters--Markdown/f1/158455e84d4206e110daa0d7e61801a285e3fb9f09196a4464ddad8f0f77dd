<p>In a sequential execution model, statements are executed serially. The fetch-decode-execute cycle runs on a single thread. This is contrasted by <em>parallel execution model</em> where tasks are performed on multiple threads with it not being necessary that one task must be finished before the next one starts.</p>

<h2 id="previous-standards-for-c">Previous standards for C</h2>

<p>The current C standard is C18, though the language has not changed significantly since C89/C90. This standard for example does not allow the use of <em>C++ style comments</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">// comment</code>) and only allows <em>C style comments</em> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/* comment */</code>).
GCC allows us to specify which standard of the language we wish to use by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-std</code> flag.</p>

<p>For example, to compile a program using the C89 standard, we can enter the following command in our shell:</p>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gcc <span class="nt">-std</span><span class="o">=</span>c89 file.c 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows for great <em>backwards-compatibility</em>, which makes <em>legacy</em> software easier to maintain.</p>
